# Text-to-Voice-Generation
Built a production ready Rails API that converts text to speech using ElevenLabs. The system processes requests asynchronously with Sidekiq, stores audio on Cloudinary, tracks request states, handles errors gracefully, and applies rate limiting for safe and scalable usage.
